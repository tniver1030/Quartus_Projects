			Block Diagram UART Motor Controller

What
---------
This project was created for a Logic Design course's final project. We were to design an FSM that read values
from an Arduino over UART and PWM a motor through an HBridge accordingly to change the speed.

How
---------
Open Quartus II (I use 9.0) and click open project. Then navigate to the file called 'Project6.qpf. This will open
everything needed to use the project
